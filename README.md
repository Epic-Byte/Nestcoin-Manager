# Nestcoin-Manager

# Problem 
Nestcoin is a film house that would like to further engage with their audience.
They would like to create a "currency", which would be used to reward loyal customers. 
The currency could later be traded for backstage passes and other perks. 
Interestingly they began accepting crypto-based payments a year earlier and would like to harness the power of Web3 to implement their solution.
You and your team have been tasked with developing a solution. 
You will also be required to develop a system that allows them to batch transactions together so they can distribute their "currency" as quickly and efficiently as possible.
